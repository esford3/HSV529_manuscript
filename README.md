Code to reproduce figures 1-5: 
code/HSV_529_Fig_1.R (dotplots for CD4, CD8, TRB clonotypes, clonality)
code/HSV_529_Fig_2.R (dotplots and clonotype tracking for blood overlappers)
code/HSV_529_Fig_3.R (clonotype tracking for expanders and comparison of expanding clonotypes by dose)
code/HSV_529_Fig_4.R (comparison of V gene usage)
code/HSV_529_Fig_5.R (logoplot, HLA sharing)
